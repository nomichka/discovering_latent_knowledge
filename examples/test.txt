Ditto to other complaints - won't separate easily- either by unscrewing or prizing. Cheap, flimsy, leaks water also because no gasket. I'm looking for something else and hoping reviewers will give honest good advice . . . this almost identical to product by Munchkin

We tried the Baby warming dish. We found that for our 1 year old it was pretty small, and didn't really hold enough water to keep her warm.I think it would work ok for an infant, although I think a blanket would work just as well.Recommendation:Buy********************HoldSell
Is this review positive? yes
As good as this book may be, the print quality is so bad that I cannot read it. Zero stars would have been more appropriate.
Is this review positive? no
I used the generator for a circuits project and it works pretty well with little resistance, however the wire connections seemed cheap and very loose. I would recommend buying a battery powered one with rechargeable batteries if you're worried about the environment.

The early success of Adam Sandler's films gave him this mistaken impression that he was an actor and a writer. This film proves he is neither - and a grating voice-over guy to boot. I enjoyed Happy Gilmore and to a much lesser degree, Little Nicky and Big Daddy. But Sandler is a one-trick pony. We've all seen the trick, so it's just not interesting anymore. I thought this might be the one Hanukah film in a world of X-mas fare. It has nothing to do with the holiday and is definitely not for kids.
Is this review positive? no
god!!! what a dumb movie. the fact that Adam Sandler can do this is just wrong....never lives up to what if true and it down right smells like cheese....sick and demented jokes dont help its premise...though Whitey gets a few lifes...nicely animated but a poor outcome. think of this as a guide beofer watching it...Jon Lovitz, Rob Schneider and others contribute voices.

A movie that makes you feel a lot better about the holidays. Although not a childish movie, Eight Crazy Nights is a fantastic Sandler movie.
Is this review positive? yes
The movie is vulgar and not meant for children. It is a typical Adam Sandler movie, with foul language and raunchy humor. Not enjoyable at all.
Is this review positive? no
8 Crazy Nights might have been a sweet film with a good message for kids, but the scatological humor, offensive language and explicit sexual references made it unsuitable for my 10-year old. The plot, on the other hand, while fine for 10-year olds was too obvious and simplistic for most of the adults in the audience. As a result, while it's probably not the worst film of the year, it is certainly in the running.
Is this review positive? no
This film has the dubious honor to be included in the book "The 50 worst films of all time". It is definently not one of those, but one can hardly call it a proper film, either. It is rather a loose framework in which 12 new songs could be presented in a more or less natural manner. A great-great-grandfather of music videos, and better than some of those!
